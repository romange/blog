My personal opinion is that this style is hard to work with in C++. In this post I would like to cover alternative, Fiber-based approach. I will use Boost.Fibers library in all my examples.
Fibers, or green threads, or cooperative threads are similar to regular threads but with few important distinctions:
Fibers can not move between system threads and they are usually pinned to a specific thread.</description></item></channel></rss>
