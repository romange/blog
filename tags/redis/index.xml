Redis was initially designed as a simple store, and it seems that its APIs achieved this goal.
Unfortunately, Redis&amp;rsquo;s simple design makes it unreliable and difficult to manage in production.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the question is - what simplicity means to you as a datastore user?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Redis Analysis - Part 1: Threading model</title><link>https://www.romange.com/2021/12/09/redis-analysis-part-1-threading-model/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 11:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.romange.com/2021/12/09/redis-analysis-part-1-threading-model/</guid><description>&lt;p>Following my previous post, we are going start with the &amp;ldquo;hottest potato&amp;rdquo; - single-threaded vs

of numerous dev-ops and software engineers. Indeed, according to &lt;a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#databases">StackOverflow survey in
2021&lt;/a>, Redis is the most loved database for the 5th time in a row and is at the top of
&lt;a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/key-value+store">db-engines&lt;/a> ranking, way before the next contestant.
But how well does Redis utilizes modern hardware systems?
Will it stay competitive in a few years without reinventing itself?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
